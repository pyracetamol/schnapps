*A collection of interactive Streamlit apps for phase-field and Monte Carlo simulations in materials modeling.*

This repository hosts a series of browser-based simulation apps built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). These tools are designed for:

- Exploring microstructure evolution via **phase-field models**
- Simulating a 2D Ising lattice via **Monte Carlo methods**

All simulations are written in **Python** and run entirely in the browser once deployed.

## Run locally

To run any app locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `streamlit run allen-cahn_app.py`
